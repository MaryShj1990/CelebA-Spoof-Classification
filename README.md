# CelebA-Spoof-Classification
This project investigates the classification performance of deep CNNs on the CelebA-spoof dataset. Regarding this, I take the visual features extracted by three deep CNNs: VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Xception and utilize them as an input to my own classifiers. Then, I implement a hybrid model by concatenating the features of VGG-16 and ResNet-50 with the best performance such that the classification accuracy is increased compared with using the individual CNNsâ€™ features. Finally, in order to validate the classification performance of the hybrid model in practice, it can be tested on image samples from the real world.
